## Overview

The Time-Weighted Average Balance (TWAB) Controller is a system that keeps track of users token balances, their historic balances and their average balances of historic time periods. It is calculated by looking at the balances held during a queried time period, weighting them based on the duration they were held and returning an average amount held for the whole time period.

This ability to look back in time is critically important for PoolTogether, so that users can deposit and withdraw freely into a prize pool while having their liquidity contribution measured perfectly.

For example:

- If a user held 100 tokens for 1 week, then their average balance over that time was 100.
- If instead they held 100 for half of the week and then 200 for the second half, then their average for the week would be 150.

## Development

### Installation

You may have to install the following tools to use this repository:

- [Foundry](https://github.com/foundry-rs/foundry) to compile and test contracts
- [direnv](https://direnv.net/) to handle environment variables
- [lcov](https://github.com/linux-test-project/lcov) to generate the code coverage report

Install dependencies:

```
npm i
```

### Env

Copy `.envrc.example` and write down the env variables needed to run this project.

```
cp .envrc.example .envrc
```

Once your env variables are setup, load them with:

```
direnv allow
```

### Compile

Run the following command to compile the contracts:

```
npm run compile
```

### Coverage

Forge is used for coverage, run it with:

```
npm run coverage
```

You can then consult the report by opening `coverage/index.html`:

```
open coverage/index.html
```

### Code quality

[Husky](https://typicode.github.io/husky/#/) is used to run [lint-staged](https://github.com/okonet/lint-staged) and tests when committing.

[Prettier](https://prettier.io) is used to format TypeScript and Solidity code. Use it by running:

```
npm run format
```

[Solhint](https://protofire.github.io/solhint/) is used to lint Solidity files. Run it with:

```
npm run hint
```

### Tests

Test names including `SLOW` will be skipped on default test runs and need to be explicitly run.

### CI

A default Github Actions workflow is setup to execute on push and pull request.

It will build the contracts and run the test coverage.

You can modify it here: [.github/workflows/coverage.yml](.github/workflows/coverage.yml)

For the coverage to work, you will need to setup the `MAINNET_RPC_URL` repository secret in the settings of your Github repository.
